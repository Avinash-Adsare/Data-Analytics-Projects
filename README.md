# 1) Heart Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a classification model to predict whether a person is at risk of a heart attack based on medical and lifestyle-related factors. The dataset consists of patient records collected from various hospitals in the US.

## Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset.
- Identify key factors contributing to heart attacks.
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate records.
- Implement machine learning models for classification.
- Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **US_Heart_Patients.csv**, which contains various medical and demographic attributes of patients along with an indicator of whether they suffered a heart attack or not.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values and duplicates.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Feature scaling and selection.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Distribution of Heart Attack Cases**  
- **Correlation Heatmap**  
- **Feature Distributions**  

### 3. Model Building

- Implemented machine learning models including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation

- Metrics used for evaluation:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC Score
- **ROC Curve Comparison**  

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and visualization

## Results & Insights

- Identified key risk factors contributing to heart attacks.
- The best-performing model achieved high accuracy in predicting heart attack risk.
- Insights from the analysis can help in early detection and prevention strategies.

## Future Improvements
